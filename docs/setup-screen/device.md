# Device Configuration

The Device Menu enables in-depth configurations:

- **Communication Types:**

Each communication type utilizes a specific transmission method to send the data:

    - BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy): Transmits data wirelessly using BLE technology.
    - CAN (Controller Area Network): Communicates over a CAN bus, commonly used in automotive environments.
    - RS232: Transmits data through a serial connection.

| **Type**       | **Mode**      | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BLE**         | Filtered      | Allows setup of a vehicle and its tires, only displays sensors for this setup.  |
|                 | Unfiltered    | Displays all sensors around without a vehicle layout.                          |
| **CAN**         | Filtered      | Supports vehicle and tire setup, listening only to configured sensors.         |
|                 | Unfiltered    | Displays any sensor data without a specific layout.                            |
|                 | CAN Garage    | A specific CAN mode tailored for garage or workshop environments.|
|                 | EBS    | A specific CAN mode tailored for Trailer EBS systems.|
|                 | RAW    | Custom communication types tailored for specific use cases.|
|                 | J1939    | A specific CAN mode tailored for J1939.|
|                 | Unfiltered (old)    | A specific CAN mode tailored for J1939.|
| **RS232**       | Filtered      | Allows for vehicle and tire-specific setup, displaying configured sensors only.|
|                 | Unfiltered    | Displays all sensor data without any predefined configuration.|
|                 | Tacograph    | Custom communication types tailored for specific use cases.  |

- **Vehicle Setup:** Assign a vehicle as a truck or trailer.
- **Temperature Compensation:** Adjust pressure readings based on temperature.
- **RF Settings:** Configure single or dual RF channels with specific sensor communication type.

For Trucks only:

- **Number of Trailers,** specify the number of trailers (0â€“7).
- **Enable Drop and Hook,** for automatic trailer detection and ordering.
- **Input Trailer MAC IDs,** manually or via QR codes.

For CAN only:

- **CAN Termination:** Enables or disables termination resistance, essential for maintaining signal integrity on the CAN bus.
- **CAN Speed:** Selectable speeds of 250 kbps or 500 kbps, accommodating different CAN network standards.
- **CAN Address:** Configurable CAN IDs to avoid conflicts and ensure proper communication in multi-device environments.
